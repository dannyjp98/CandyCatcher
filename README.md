BONUS FEATURES:
I added a new setting in the settings panel to change the duration that items are out for.

I also added a gameover screen when the player reaches 5000pts. This calls a function for gameOver() which clears all existing timers like the float and throwing timers.

Lastly, I added audio to the game whenever the player collects an item. This required me to find audio samples on freesound.com and implement it using javascripts Audio objects. This was the most interesting to add since it added good feedback for the player to enhance their playing experience.
